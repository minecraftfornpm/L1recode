## Usage
1. Download the specific scripting utility of your choice.
2. Execute the provided loadstring below.
```luau
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minecraftfornpm/L1recode/refs/heads/main/Loader.lua"))()
```

## Possible Issues
Half of the time its usually the scripting utility at fault, please make sure the utility meets certain quality standards such as.
1. Supporting file functions & the debug library.
2. Not implementing lua generated / half baked versions of such functions resulting in unintended behavior.
3. Maintaing the same behavior across all usages of said functions.
### User Issues
If its not the supposed utility at fault, please try some troubleshooting steps.
1. Making sure you have connection to [the main loadstring.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minecraftfornpm/L1recode/refs/heads/main/Loader.lua")
2. Ensuring no external script is conflicting.
